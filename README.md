# SORTERA (Sorting Operations and Real-Time Efficient Rendering and Analysis)

**Sortera** is a web-based sorting algorithm visualizer that allows users to generate random arrays and visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The tool is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand how different sorting algorithms work by displaying step-by-step visualizations of the sorting process.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- **Customizable Array Size**: Users can adjust the size of the array to sort.
- **Adjustable Animation Speed**: Provides control over the speed of the sorting animations.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Displays algorithm details such as name, time complexity, space complexity, and time taken for sorting.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Features intuitive controls for generating new arrays, selecting algorithms, and modifying parameters.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building the visualizer.
- **JavaScript Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms.

## How to Use

1. **Generate New Array**: Click the "Generate New Array" button to create a random array.
2. **Adjust Array Size**: Use the slider to select the size of the array.
3. **Select Sorting Algorithm**: Choose an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
4. **Control Animation Speed**: Adjust the speed of the animation using the slider.
5. **Visualize Sorting**: The selected algorithm will sort the array in real-time with visual cues.
